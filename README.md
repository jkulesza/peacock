# Fork of [Peacock](https://github.com/jkulesza/peacock) with [improved montage script](https://github.com/Blizihguh/peacock/blob/master/readme_files/montage_python.sh)
I also submitted a PR but I don't think Peacock is being maintained, so you can also just clone this repo if you need it.
Note that Peacock.py does not work with monochrome/grayscale images. I am not sure if there's any reason to use Peacock.py on a grayscale image, but it's notable.
